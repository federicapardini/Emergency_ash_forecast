# Real-time ash forecast at Mt. Etna

When VONA RED bulletins are released, numerical simulations are initialized and performed automatically and in real-time to forecast ash dispersion and deposition patterns.

The numerical codes used in this procedure are the eruptive column model PLUME-MoM-TSM and the VATDM HYSPLIT.

For each RED VONA bulletin released at time YYYY-MM-DD/HH-mm Z, a directory named YYYYMMDD_HHmmZ is created and results uploaed automatically.

Select the directory of interest and the file XXX.md to see the latest results. For more details on the numerical procedure and results, select the YYY.md
